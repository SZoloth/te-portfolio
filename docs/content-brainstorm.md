Monthly firmware updates for yourself:
- **SHIPPED**: What you completed
- **LEARNED**: Insights and realizations
- **EXPLORING**: What you're curious about
- **KNOWN ISSUES**: Challenges you're working through
- **DEPRECATIONS**: What you're moving away from
- **META**: Reflection on the month

## Priority Discussion

**High impact, lower effort:**
- Personal release notes (content already exists in git history, tasks, notes)
- Case study expansion (foundation exists)

**High impact, higher effort:**
- Thought leadership writing (requires consistent creation)
- Interactive elements (requires technical implementation)

**Quick wins:**
- About page enhancement
- Contact optimization

## Next Steps
1. Create changelog page structure
2. Draft November release notes (first entry)
3. Expand one case study as template
