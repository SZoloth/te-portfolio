## Writing Guidelines

### Voice
- First person, conversational
- Show thinking, not just outputs
- Honest about challenges and failures

### Evidence
- Include direct quotes from stakeholders
- Show actual artifacts, not recreations
- Cite specific metrics where available

### Length
- Aim for 5-10 minute read
- Use progressive disclosure for depth
- Scannable structure with clear headers

### Visuals
- Before/after comparisons
- Process diagrams
- Real screenshots over polished mockups
