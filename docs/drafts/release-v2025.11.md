## LEARNED

- **"You are not lacking skills. You are lacking visibility."** - The career capital audit crystallized that the bottleneck isn't capability, it's discoverability
- **The avoidance pattern has a name** - "architect systems, avoid needle-movers" - I build elaborate frameworks instead of doing the scary direct things (sending outreach, publishing content, having conversations)
- **Career Capital Formula**: `Impact = (Skill × Visibility × Network) / Perfectionism` - perfectionism is the denominator killing everything
- **JSC accountability works** - external commitment changes behavior faster than internal intention

---

## EXPLORING

- **Dopamine fasting** - started research rabbit hole on whether it's real science or pop neuro (verdict: TBD)
- **AI-assisted career coaching** - using Claude as accountability partner, not just research assistant
- **Claude Code as daily driver** - deeper integration into workflows
- **Ski strength program** - Phase 2 of hybrid running/lifting for ski season
- **Blueprint-adjacent protocols** - applying longevity thinking without biomarker obsession

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- **The architect-avoidance pattern** - still catching myself building systems instead of sending the message
- **Visibility execution gap** - career systems are built, but content output is still zero
- **"Ship before you flinch" not yet habit** - know I should, don't yet default to it
- **Social anxiety still blocking networking** - better frameworks, same hesitation

---

## DEPRECATIONS

- **Waiting until ready** - moving to "ship rough, iterate in public"
- **Solo job search** - replaced with JSC accountability structure
- **Perfectionist resume tweaking** - one version, send it, learn from responses

---

## META

**Theme for November:** Building the machine
**What worked:** Creating comprehensive systems gave clarity on the actual problem (visibility, not skill)
**What didn't:** Still too much building, not enough shipping
**One word:** Foundation
