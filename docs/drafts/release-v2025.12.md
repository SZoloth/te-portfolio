## LEARNED

- **Building > Planning** - December flipped the ratio: shipped 6 apps/prototypes vs. November's system-building focus
- **TestFlight is a forcing function** - ControlTower shipped because external deadline (Carter's family needs it)
- **Voice UI is underrated** - PubMed bot revealed how powerful voice-first research can be
- **Trip planning as product work** - asia-trip-planner used same discovery/iteration patterns as client work

---

## EXPLORING

- **Multi-agent orchestration** - agent-os-skills submodule for coordinated AI workflows
- **Offline-first PWA patterns** - asia-trip-planner as testbed for service worker strategies
- **LLM evaluation pipelines** - systematic quality measurement for AI features
- **Portfolio as product** - treating te-portfolio with same rigor as client work

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- **Context switching tax** - jumping between ControlTower, DWA, PubMed, portfolio in same week
- **Ship velocity vs. polish tradeoff** - ControlTower bugs discovered in TestFlight that should have been caught earlier
- **Documentation debt** - shipping fast but not capturing learnings systematically

---

## DEPRECATIONS

- **Old portfolio-site** - replaced by te-portfolio with new design system
- **Manual trip planning** - asia-trip-planner now handles logistics

---

## META

**Theme for December:** Ship mode
**What worked:** External deadlines (TestFlight, trip dates) drove completion
**What didn't:** Too many parallel projects - context switching hurt depth
**One word:** Velocity
